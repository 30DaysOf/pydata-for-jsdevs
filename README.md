# PyData For JS Devs

This repository contains documentation and tutorials that can help a JavaScript (or any non-Python) developer get skilled up in data analysis using Python, with the help of AI assistance.

## Motivation

The project was originally inspired by some challenges I faced as both a web developer and an educator, dealing with some real-world applications. You can learn more about my story from [this talk](https://nyc2023.pydata.org/cfp/talk/D9BGVX/) that I will be giving at PyData NYC in November 2023.

GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to your shiny new codespace! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Python and Jupyter notebooks.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.
