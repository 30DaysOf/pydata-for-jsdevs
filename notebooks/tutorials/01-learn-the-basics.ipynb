    "# Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use. It has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some of the key features of Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Dynamic typing: variables do not need to be declared before use\n",
    "# - Automatic memory management: garbage collection frees up memory automatically\n",
    "# - Interpreted: code is executed line by line, without the need for compilation\n",
    "# - Object-oriented: everything in Python is an object, with methods and properties\n",
    "# - Extensive standard library: Python comes with a large collection of modules and packages for various purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python is used in a wide range of applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Web development: frameworks like Django and Flask are popular for building web applications\n",
    "# - Scientific computing: libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas are used for data analysis and visualization\n",
    "# - Artificial intelligence: libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch are used for machine learning and deep learning\n",
