    "\n",
    "Dunder methods are used to define how objects of a class behave in certain situations. For example, the `__init__` method is used to initialize an object when it is created, while the `__str__` method is used to define how an object is represented as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"dunder\" comes from the fact that these methods have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names. \"Dunder\" is short for \"double underscore\". For example, `__init__` is pronounced \"dunder init\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Dunder methods are an important part of Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) model, and understanding how they work is essential for creating well-designed and efficient Python programs.\n",
